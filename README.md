# CysTileCutter
I made this tile-cutter program to use together with my CysMaps! I made this becasue I was unhappy with other tile-cutting programs : )

## What is tile-cutting?
Tile-cutting is used by Google Maps and Leaflet, this allows you to zoom in on maps while retaining the quality of the image and speed of the website.

Usually, this include some downscaling of the quality when you zoom out, and increase when you zoom in. To ensure that your viewers only see what they need to, and not a pixel more.

## How to use this program
- Copy this repository by downloading it from [here]() or using solutions like GitKraken
